# Kick Start solutions in Kotlin

This project is just a version of solutions for [Google Kick Start](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart/about)
problems written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/).

It requires [JDK 11](https://jdk.java.net/11/) and [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) to develop and test
the solutions locally. The testing is done directly on Kick Start platform in practice mode.

There is a new solution template `Kick Start Solution` in IDEA templates which might need to be activated in the Settings
under `File and Code Templates` by choosing `Scheme: Project`.
